## Read and Visualize

In this milestone, you'll use ggplot2 to visualize how the number of COVID-19 cases evolved in the state of New York (NY). But before you begin, you'll need to import the `covid` data set. Unlike Milestone 1, the data set has not been loaded for you.


## Recreation

### Part 1 - Import

In the code chunk below, use a command from the readr package to read in the data set.

* The data set lives in the file `covid.csv`, which is stored in the `data/` folder in your working directory.
* Save the data set as an object named `covid`.


```{r}
#| label: recreation-import
# Remember that all tidyverse packages have already been installed for you,
# but you will need to *load* the ones you want to use. As a best practice when
# working within a Quarto document like this one, load any packages you
# will use within the code chunk labeled `setup` at the top of the file.

covid <- read_csv("data/covid.csv")

```

### Part 2 - Visualize

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot.


```{r}
#| label: recreate-this
#| message: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone02.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above. Before plotting, you will first need to filter your data set to only include observations from New York.


```{r}
#| label: recreation-visualize
# Remember that all tidyverse packages have already been installed for you,
# but you will need to *load* the ones you want to use. As a best practice when
# working within a Quarto document like this one, load any packages you
# will use within the code chunk labeled `setup` at the top of the file.
glimpse(covid)

covid %>% 
  filter(state == "NY") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = cases)) +
  geom_line()

```

## Extension

Using the code chunk below, investigate a research question about this data, using the visualization skills you learned this week. Some ideas:

1. Your recreation focused on the evolution of COVID-19 cases in the state of New York. How does the trajectory of New York compare to another state with similar case counts?
2. Do you see similar patterns across states? Does this answer change if you look at only high (or low) case counts?
3. Within a state or states of interest, what patterns do you see between number of cases and number of deaths over time?
4. [any other research question of interest]

Alternately, working with a data set of your own, complete the following: 

1. Read in your data
2. Filter your data using a logical test/condition 
3. Graph this data subset using at least one geom 



```{r}
#| label: extension

filter(covid, is.na(cases))

# average daily increase in positive and probable COVID-19 cases by state
case_counts <- covid %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(avg_increase = mean(cases))

filter(case_counts, state == "NY")
#!!! average increase of 4,531 cases in NY

# other states with similar case numbers
filter(case_counts, avg_increase >= 3000,
       avg_increase <= 5000)
#!!! FL (4,726) and IL (3,248) have the closest average increase in cases to NY

covid %>% 
  filter(state %in% c("NY", "FL", "IL")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = cases, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Dark2")

```
- These three states had similar average case increase rates
- FL and NY had peaks in cases earlier in the year (~Apr - July), while IL had their peak around December 2020
- FL & NY had a similar additional peak in early 2021
